I am a professional web (React.js/Angular/Vue) and mobile developer with 7+ years of experience. I prefer to code from scratch and create fully custom websites. My designs follow a minimalist approach and focus on simplistic powerful aesthetics. I have completed a wide range of projects for 7+ years.
